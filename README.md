# Predicting Diabetes
M148 Project
Dataset obtained from: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/iammustafatz/diabetes-prediction-dataset/data

## Overview
This project focuses on predicting diabetes using a variety of models with the Diabetes Prediction Dataset. The dataset includes features such as age, gender, body mass index (BMI), hypertension, heart disease, smoking history, HbA1c level, and blood glucose level. The goal is to build machine learning models that can accurately predict diabetes status based on these features.

## Introduction
Diabetes is a chronic condition that affects millions of people every day worldwide. Early detection and management are important for preventing  complications. This project aims to utilize machine learning techniques to predict the likelihood of diabetes in patients based on their medical and demographic information.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is obtained from Kaggle: [Diabetes Prediction Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mohammedmustafa/diabetes-prediction-dataset). It contains the following features:
- `gender`: Biological sex of the individual (male, female, other).
- `age`: Age of the individual.
- `hypertension`: Presence of hypertension (0 for no, 1 for yes).
- `heart_disease`: Presence of heart disease (0 for no, 1 for yes).
- `smoking_history`: Smoking history (not current, former, no info, current, never, ever).
- `bmi`: Body Mass Index.
- `HbA1c_level`: Hemoglobin A1c level.
- `blood_glucose_level`: Blood glucose level.
- `diabetes`: Target variable indicating the presence of diabetes (0 for no, 1 for yes).
